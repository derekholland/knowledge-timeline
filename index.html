          <p>My next programming class at WKU was an introductory course in Python. We did coding exercises and assignments out of our textbook. My first class in web development was an introduction to wordpress. The final project for this course was an e-commerce site. I built a t-shirt store that sold sci-fi themed shirts.</p>

          <p>I started to really look for online resources that would teach me programming skills. I discovered Udemy and started taking courses in web development. This started my journey with web development technologies and deep self-study into programming.</p>

          <p>Since I was a student and worked up to 50 hours a week at my job it was difficult to dedicate the time I wanted to towards learning web development but I continued to use udemy and other online resources to learn coding. I started to learn the basics of React and continued to learn web development.</p>

          <p>I read a book called "Breaking the Code". This book was all about breaking into the tech industry. The programming language the author recommends is C# and the .net stack. I decided to learn some C#. This was the year I graduated from WKU with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Information Technology.</p>

          <h3><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i> 2021: Fullstack Web Development. Git, GitHub and PERN Stack.</h3>
          <p>I am finished with school and can concentrate more time and energy on my dream of becoming a fullstack web developer. I decided to invest in better resources to help me reach my goal so I signed up for a year subscription to Codecademy. I am following their Full-stack engineer curriculum that teaches the PERN stack. I combined this with some amazing courses by Brad Traversy on udemy and I am making really good progress. I am also using git and github for version control during my projects. My goal is to build a personal portfolio of impressive projects and land my first dev job this year!</p>
